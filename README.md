# LAB 21 - Class 21

## Project Name - Counter React App

Code 401 Lab 21 - Component Based UI

Create a stateful React application. This application will use component based UI ideology to create modular React classes / functions.

Your application should implement the same basic functionality, though note that other pieces such as styling, layout, text content, etc. can be completely up to you! Here are the major functionality pieces:

- Header and footer elements with some styling and text
- An increment count button which adds 1 to the current count
- A decrement count button which subtracts 1 from the current count
- A current count display that is initialized at 0 and updates as the count changes
